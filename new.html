        <h1 class="fonty"><b>stray puppy are all over world!!!</b></h1>
            <p>Stray dogs are common in many urban and rural areas, often living without a permanent home.They can form packs and rely on scavenging for food. 
                These dogs face numerous challenges, including harsh weather, disease, and lack of medical care.<br><br>
                 Many communities have initiatives to address stray dog populations through spaying, neutering, and adoption programs. Promoting responsible pet ownership and supporting animal shelters can help reduce the number of stray dogs.
